## Contribute
Your contribution is welcome! Please create a pull request (PR). The STACKIT Developer Tools team will review it.

The SDK service modules are automatically generated from the [REST API specs](https://github.com/stackitcloud/stackit-api-specifications). Therefore, changes to these modules will not be accepted. Instead, consider proposing changes to the generation process in the [Generator repository](https://github.com/stackitcloud/stackit-sdk-generator)

A more detailed contribution guideline is planned to come.
